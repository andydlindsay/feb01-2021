# W03D04 - Security & Real World HTTP Servers

### To Do
- [x] Storing passwords
- [x] Encrypted cookies
- [x] HTTP Secure (HTTPS)
- [x] REST [Stretch]
- [x] More HTTP methods/`Method Override` [Stretch]

### Storing Passwords
* We **never** want to store passwords as plain text
* Passwords should always be _hashed_ 
* **Hashing**:
  * The original string is passed into a function that performs some kind of transformation on it and returns a different string (the _hash_)
  * This is a one way process: a hashed value cannot be retrieved
* We make hashing more secure by adding a _salt_ to the original string prior to hashing
* This [helps to protect against Rainbow Table attacks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/420843/how-does-password-salt-help-against-a-rainbow-table-attack)

### Encrypted Cookies
* Plain text cookies can be manipulated by users
* It's better practice to use _encrypted_ cookies
* **Encryption**:
  * Similar to hashing, the string is scrambled/transformed by a function
  * This is a two-way process: encrypted strings can be decrypted by the intended recipient

### HTTP Secure (HTTPS)
* HTTPS uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt communication between client and server
* Encrypted using asymmetric cryptography which uses a public key and private key system
* The public key is available to anyone who wants it and is used to encrypt the communication
* The private key is known only to the receiver and is used to decrypt the communication

### When to use...
* Plain Text Cookies:
  * Almost never use plain cookies
  * Maybe for:
    * Language selection
    * Shopping cart for non-logged in users
    * Analytics
* Encrypted Cookies:
  * Do this by default
  * Only store a way to uniquely identify the user (eg. `user_id` or `username` can be used to look up values in a database or object)

### REST (Representational State Transfer)

* REST means that the path that we are going to should represent the data being transferred
* An API that uses the REST convention is said to be RESTful
* RESTful routes look like:

  | **Method** | **Path** | **Purpose** |
  |:---:|:---|:---|
  | GET | /resources | Retrieve all of a resource (Browse) |
  | GET | /resources/:id | Retrieve a particular resource (Read) |
  | POST | /resources/:id | Update a resource (Edit) |
  | POST | /resources | Create a new resource (Add) |
  | POST | /resources/:id/delete | Delete an existing resource (Delete) |

* RESTful API's have some advantages:
  * If I know that your API is RESTful, then I can easily guess at what endpoints you have defined and I don't need to read your documentation to figure it out
  * Results in clean URLs (ie. `/resource` instead of `/get-my-resource`)
  * The desired action is implied by the HTTP verb
  * This method of specifying URLs is chainable (eg. `/user/123`, `/user/123/resource` or `/user/123/resource/456`)

* Selectors are always plural (eg. `/resources`, `/users`)
* Actions are always singular (eg. `/login`, `/register`)

### More HTTP Methods
- We have more [*verbs*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) available to us than just `GET` and `POST`
- Popular ones are `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`
- `PUT`: used to replace an existing resource
- `PATCH`: update part of an exisiting resource
- `DELETE`: delete an existing resource
- We can access these other methods via AJAX requests (we'll introduce you to AJAX in week 4) or by using the [`method-override`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override) package
- Using these new verbs, our routes table now looks like:

  | **Method** | **Path** | **Purpose** |
  |:---:|:---|:---|
  | GET | /resources | Retrieve all of a resource (Browse) |
  | GET | /resources/:id | Retrieve a particular resource (Read) |
  | PUT | /resources/:id | Replace a resource (Edit) |
  | PATCH | /resources/:id | Update a resource (Edit) |
  | POST | /resources | Create a new resource (Add) |
  | DELETE | /resources/:id | Delete an existing resource (Delete) |

### Modular Routing
- Store routes in multiple files to keep them organized
- In Express, we need to use the Express.Router() method to give us back a **router** object
- All routes will be added to this _router_ object
- Finally, we export the _router_ object from the file to be imported into our Express server file (eg. `server.js`)

  ```js
  // post-router.js
  const express = require('express');
  const router = express.Router();

  router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    // typical route handler in here
    res.send('hello world');
  });

  module.exports = router;

  // server.js
  const postRouter = require('./routes/post-router');
  app.use('/posts', postRouter);
  ```

### JSON API's
- So far, our servers have been returning server-side rendered templates, but our Express server can be configured to return different types of information including strings/objects (`res.send`), files (`res.sendFile`), and JSON (`res.json`)
- JSON API's are concerned only with sending data (as opposed to HTML), so they are typically consumed with AJAX requests
