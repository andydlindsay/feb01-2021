# Mock Exam Review

### Tips and Tricks
* Read the question thoroughly
* What data do you have access to? This will be the argument(s) to your function.
* What data do you want to get back? This is the return value from your function.
* Don't spend too long on a single question. Jump ahead and come back.
* Use pseudo code to plan out your logic
* Rubber duck with yourself. Review your logic out loud as you might find some logical fallacies in your thinking.
* Write the minimum amount of code to make the test(s) pass
* Make the test(s) pass, then refactor your code to fix any `eslint` errors/warnings
* Google for syntax!
* If you wonder "is there a problem with the test or a problem with my code?"... there's a problem with your code :)
